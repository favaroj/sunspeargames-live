                                <p>Five years ago, several members of the RTS modding community met to discuss the future of esports. Their passion for a better competitive experience turned to a clear vision: an RTS that anyone could play or watch, with worlds and characters anyone could fall in love with.  Combining the talent, years of Research and Development that lead to IMMORTAL, with the talent to lead and build the product was the next step. We’re proud to share the team we have today, bringing passionate professionals from Riot Games, Sony America, and Nintendo America.</p>
